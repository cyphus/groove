Groove89 Song File format:
zero terminated songtitle (max 20 chars)
zero terminated songartist (max 20 chars)
Word-aligned minbpm, maxbpm, modebpm (2 bytes each)
Word-aligned two byte flag variable:
	bits 0-4: flag set if difficulty exists in file
		difficulties are Beginner, light, standard, heavy, and challenge respectively.
	bits 5-15: Reserved for future versions, perhaps containing version info.
		Current versions will warn if these bits are not 0.
For each difficulty flag set:
	one byte describing foot rating (a value up to 15 -- yes only 4 bits are necessary, 
		but the C struct handling code would more than make up the difference.)
	five bytes describing the five radar values ("voltage", "stream", "chaos", "freeze", and "air")
	four bytes for file offset for stepchart (absolute offset from beginning of file)

A list of BPM changes in the following format:
	two bytes describing beat offset as an unsigned integer
	one byte describing the offset of the offset in 1/64ths
	two bytes describing the BPM at that offset
two byte 0 signifying end of BPM changes list (note that this is the second 0 in the list)

Each step in the stepchart data follows this pattern
	XXXX0000 	for a regular tap note. The first (i.e. most significant) four bits are for left, down, up, and right respectively
	X000X000	If for a regular tap note there is a corresponding flag set in the other four bits, the tap
					note is treated as a hold. There should be one of these for the start of a hold, and another
					for the end.
	000X00X0	If a hold flag is set that does not match a tap flag, that denotes a special code. they go as follows:
	
	1000XXXX	resolution code (note that Groove assumes a 1/4 resolution until told otherwise):
					1000 1111  -  1/4 resolution
					1000 0111  -  1/8 resolution
					1000 0011  -  1/16 resolution
					1000 0001  -  1/32 resolution
					1000 0010  -  1/64 resolution
					1000 0100  -  1/12 resolution
					1000 0101  -  1/24 resolution
	10100101	End of notes tag.
